# Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a open source framework powered by React.js that allows developer to build highly optimized front-end applications.

## Why use Gatsby
- Blazing Fast (passes all lighthouse tests out of the box)
- SEO built in
- Easy to use
- Built off of React
- AMAZING DOCUMENTATION (probably the best part)

## Let's Get Started

- `npm i -g gatsby-cli`
- `gatsby new [your app name]`
- `cd [your app name]`
- `gatsby develop`

## Difference between gatsby develop and gatsby build
In simple terms gatsby develop launches a hot-reloading development enviroment for building your app (think npm start).
Gatsby build will create a highly optimized version of your site by generating static HTML and JavaScript bundles.

## Check pre-built files
Take 15min to take a look at the files gatsby has generated for you and answer these questions in comparison to react:
- What looks familiar?
- What is the path of data?
- What looks different? 
- How are things rendered on the page?

## Let's Build Something
- Remove all uneeded files that were generated from gatsby new command
